    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Â½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring 
            and crumbling into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. 
            Cook until beef absorbs some sauce, about 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken in hot oil until lightly brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour honey mixture into the skillet; continue to cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
